    <h3>instructions</h3>
    <h4>Part 1: Preparing the chicken and egg stuffing</h4>
    <p>1 Cook the Chicken : </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large casserole dish or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil and butter (or ghee) over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic and sauté until softened (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and brown on all sides</li>
        <li>Incorporate the spices (ginger, turmeric, ground cinnamon, saffron threads, salt, pepper), chopped parsley and coriander. Stir to coat the chicken well.</li>
        <li>Pour enough water or stock to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the chicken is very tender.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>2 Shred the Chicken : </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the pot and let it cool. Once cooled, remove the skin and bones, then shred the meat into small pieces. Set aside.
</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3 Prepare the Egg Filling : </p>
    <ul>
        <li>While the chicken cools, reduce the remaining cooking liquid in the pot over high heat until it thickens and almost all the liquid has evaporated (about 10-15 minutes). Remove the cinnamon stick.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the beaten eggs to the reduced sauce, stirring constantly until the eggs cook and form a creamy consistency, like scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and drain the mixture if necessary to avoid a soggy pastilla. Let it cool completely.</li>
        <li>Stir the shredded chicken into the egg and onion mixture. Season to taste. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Part 2: Preparing the filling</h4>
    <p>Toast and Chop the Almonds:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blanch the almonds (if they are not already blanched).</li>
        <li>Let them cool, then roughly (or finely) crush them.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the crushed almonds with the icing sugar and ground cinnamon. Add a touch of orange blossom water if desired. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Part 3: Assembly and Baking</h4>
    <p>1 Preheat the oven : </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Assembling the Pastilla:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generously butter a round baking dish (approximately 28 cm in diameter) or a baking tray with sides.</li>
        <li>Arrange 5 to 6 sheets of warqa (or brick/filo), overlapping them and letting the edges hang well over the edge of the dish. Brush each sheet with melted butter as you assemble.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the chicken-egg mixture evenly over the pastry base.</li>
        <li>Add one or two sheets of buttered pastry on top to create a barrier.</li>
        <li>Spread the almond mixture over this layer.</li>
        <li>Add another sheet of buttered pastry, then the rest of the chicken-egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Fold the overhanging edges of the pastry sheets towards the center, brushing them with melted butter to seal the pastilla.</li>
        <li>Cover the pastilla with the remaining sheets of pastry, tucking them under the base to create a neat shape. Generously brush the top with melted butter and a little beaten egg for a beautiful golden finish.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3 Cook :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastilla is golden brown and crispy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4 Serve :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow to cool slightly. Sprinkle the top with icing sugar and decorate with streaks of ground cinnamon just before serving warm. </li>
    </ul>
