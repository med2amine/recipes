    <h3>ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fine Vermicelli noodles ( chaariya ), about 500g</li>
        <li>Butter (approx. 50g)</li>
        <li>Grapes (optional, about 1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>Powdered Sugar (for mixing in and for garnish)</li>
        <li>Cinnamon (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Ground toasted almonds (for garnish)</li>
        <li>Water/Oil/Salt (for initial steaming preparation)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>instructions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Vermicelli</strong>: Toss the fine vermicelli noodles with a little oil and salt to coat the strands.</li>
        <li><strong>First Steam</strong>: Place the coated noodles in the top basket of a couscous maker. Steam over boiling water for about 15–20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak and Fluff</strong>: Transfer the noodles to a large bowl. Sprinkle with cold salted water, add the raisins (if using), and gently fluff the noodles with your hands or a spoon to separate them. Let them absorb the water for a few minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Second Steam</strong>: Return the noodles to the couscous maker and steam for another 15 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Steam & Butter</strong>: Repeat the soak/fluff step. For the final (third or fourth) steam, cook until the noodles are tender (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li><strong>Mix & Garnish</strong>: Transfer the tender noodles to a large platter. Mix in the butter and some powdered sugar until melted and well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>: Mound the seffa into a dome shape. Garnish generously with a layer of powdered sugar, lines of ground cinnamon, and the ground toasted almonds. Serve immediately while hot.</li>
